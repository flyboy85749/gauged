# Gauged Solutions Coding Challenge

## Create a page in React using a bar chart, table and one visualization of your choice.

Used ChartJs to create the bar chart and doughnut chart, showing the top five programming languages to learn in 2022, as per https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/most-popular-programming-languages/

Color scheme from https://color.adobe.com/trends/Graphic-design

The table uses react-table. Though the info is currently hard coded, it can be pulled from an API also, to make the table dynamic. 

Used minimal CSS, including the original App.css. Used flexbox to easily align the charts in three columns on large screens.
